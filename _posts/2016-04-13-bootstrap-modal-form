I started creating again some simple applications in Rails so I tried do enhance things a bit with some Bootstrap 
modal forms. But since I'm not a Javascript/jQuery/I_don't_know_what_else guy, I tried to find resources in order to
understand and implement something like that. Since it was really hard to find some solutions, I came up to the idea to
create this post in order to have something as a future reference (together with a demo app in Github).

<h3>The concept</h3>
The concept was to create a task list (yeah I know, such an original idea). I wanted to have the ability to create a
new task or see the contents of a task using modal forms. Anyways, enough with the talking. 

First, we need to create a new Rails app. So
{% highlight powershell %}
rails new app modal-form-demo
{% endhighlight %}

At this point we've created our new application. Before we bundle install it, we can change the Gemfile in order to 
add the gems to enable Bootstrap support. Add the following in the end of your Gemfile

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'coffee-script-source', '1.8.0'
{% endhighlight %}
