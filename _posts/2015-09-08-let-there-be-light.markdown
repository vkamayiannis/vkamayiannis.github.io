So this is my first ever post, using Jekyll. But let me start over.

I've had an account on [Koding][koding] for the past, probably 2 years, and I've never had the time to start
using this awesome as it turns to be service. For those of you who don't have a clue of what I'm talking about,
just know this: [Koding][koding] provides you virtual machines on the cloud (yes!!!) with a chance to install
your favourite scripting language (I'm talking about Ruby here - but yeah ok you can install anything - not -  else)
and through an awesome IDE you can start writing whatever you want.

So, finally, the past days, I've remembered this account and I started playing with the capabilities that this service 
gives you. Finally I came accross Jekyll which reminded me that "Hey, how about starting building your own personal
website".

And this is it. It's getting late, but here I am writing my first ever post using Jekyll. Some work is needed
in order to start playing with the layout, but this will happen in time. 

Until next time...
