I'm a software engineer currently living in Thessaloniki, Greece. I've been in the industry
for almost 15 years. I'm passionate about web development, even though I've been working mostly 
with [E.R.P. software][Erpsoftware]. I love digging into new stuff and new technologies.

I'm into [Ruby][ruby-lang] for the past year, and I'm in the process for learning how to 
build a personal blog using [Jekyll][jekyll]. This is actually what I'm trying to do with this blog.blog
